<p class="firstpar">It is time to move on to computer graphics in three dimensions, although
it won't be until Section&nbsp;2 of this chapter that we really get into 3D.
You will find that many concepts from 2D graphics carry over to 3D, but the move into
the third dimension brings with it some new features that take a while to
get used to.</p>


<p>Our focus will be <span class="newword" data-term="OpenGL" data-definition="A family of computer graphics APIs that is implemented in many graphics
hardware devices.  There are several versions of the API, and there are implementations,
or &quot;bindings&quot; for several different programming languages.  Versions of OpenGL for embedded
systems such as mobile phones are known as OpenGL ES.  WebGL is a version for use on 
Web pages.  OpenGL can be used for 2D as well as for 3D graphics, but it is most commonly
associated with 3D." title="Click for a definition of OpenGL.">OpenGL</span>, a graphics API
that was introduced in 1992 and has gone through many versions and many 
changes since then.  OpenGL is a  low-level graphics API, similar to the 2D APIs we have
covered.  It is even more primitive in some ways, but of course it is
complicated by the fact that it supports 3D.</p>


<p>For the next two chapters, the discussion is
limited to OpenGL&nbsp;1.1.  OpenGL 1.1 is a large API, and we will 
only cover a part of it. The goal is to introduce 3D graphics concepts, 
not to fully cover the API.  A significant part of what we cover here
has been removed from the most modern versions of OpenGL.  However,
modern OpenGL in its pure form has a very steep initial learning curve,
and it is really not a good starting place for someone who is encountering
3D graphics for the first time.  Some additional support is needed&mdash;if not OpenGL 1.1
then some similar framework.  Since OpenGL 1.1 is
still supported, at least by all desktop implementations of OpenGL,
it's a reasonable place to start.</p>


<p>This chapter concentrates on the geometric aspects of 3D graphics, such as defining
and transforming objects and projecting 3D scenes into 2D images.  The images that
we produce will look very unrealistic.  In the next chapter, we will see how to add
some realism by simulating the effects of lighting and of the material properties of surfaces.</p>
