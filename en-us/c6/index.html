<p class="firstpar">In this chapter, we turn to <span class="newword" data-term="WebGL" data-definition="A 3D graphics API for use on web pages.  WebGL programs are written
in the JavaScript programming language and display their images in HTML canvas
elements.  WebGL is based on OpenGL ES, the version of OpenGL for embedded systems, with
a few changes to adapt it to the JavaScript language and the Web environment." title="Click for a definition of WebGL.">WebGL</span>, the version of <span class="word" data-term="OpenGL" data-definition="A family of computer graphics APIs that is implemented in many graphics
hardware devices.  There are several versions of the API, and there are implementations,
or &quot;bindings&quot; for several different programming languages.  Versions of OpenGL for embedded
systems such as mobile phones are known as OpenGL ES.  WebGL is a version for use on 
Web pages.  OpenGL can be used for 2D as well as for 3D graphics, but it is most commonly
associated with 3D." title="Click for a definition of OpenGL.">OpenGL</span>
for the Web.  <i>Three.js</i>, which was covered in the <a href="../c5/index.html">previous chapter</a>,
uses WebGL for 3D graphics.  Of course, it is more difficult to use WebGL directly, but doing
so gives you full control over the graphics hardware.  And learning it will be a good introduction
to modern graphics programming.</p>


<p>There have been many versions of OpenGL.  WebGL 1.0 is based on OpenGL ES 2.0, a version
designed for use on embedded systems such as smart phones and tablets.  OpenGL ES 1.0
was very similar to OpenGL 1.1, which we studied in <a href="../c3/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>
and <a href="../c4/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>.  However, the 2.0 version of OpenGL&nbsp;ES introduced
major changes.  It is actually a smaller, simpler <span class="word" data-term="API" data-definition="Application Programming Interface.  A collection of related classes, functions,
constants, etc., for performing some task.  An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it
can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented." title="Click for a definition of API.">API</span> that puts more responsibility
on the programmer.  For example, functions for working with transformations, such
as <i>glRotatef</i> and <i>glPushMatrix</i>, were eliminated from the API, making the
programmer responsible for keeping track of transformations.  WebGL does not
use <i>glBegin/glEnd</i> to generate geometry, and it doesn't use function such
as <i>glColor*</i> or <i>glNormal*</i> to specify attributes of vertices.  Nevertheless,
it will turn out that much of what you learned in previous chapters will carry over to
WebGL.</p>


<p>There are two sides to any WebGL program.  Part of the program is written in
<span class="word" data-term="JavaScript" data-definition="A programming language for web pages.  JavaScript code on a web
page is executed by a web browser that displays the page, and it can interact with the contents
of the web page and with the user.  There are JavaScript APIs for 2D and for 3D graphics" title="Click for a definition of JavaScript.">JavaScript</span>, the programming language for the web. The second part is
written in <span class="word" data-term="GLSL" data-definition="OpenGL Shader Language, the programming languauge that is used to write
shader programs for use with OpenGL." title="Click for a definition of GLSL.">GLSL</span>, a language for writing "shader" programs that run on the
<span class="word" data-term="GPU" data-definition="Graphics Processing Unit, a computer hardware component that performs graphical
computations that create and manipulate images.  Operations such as drawing a line on the screen 
or rendering a 3D image are done in the GPU, which is optimized to perform such operations very
quickly." title="Click for a definition of GPU.">GPU</span>. I will try to always be clear about which language I am
talking about.</p>


<p>For this introductory chapter about WebGL, we will stick to basic 
2D graphics.  You will learn about the structure of WebGL programs.  You will learn
most of the JavaScript side of the API, and you learn how to write and use simple
shaders.  In the <a href="../c7/index.html">next chapter</a>, we will move
on to 3D graphics, and you will learn a great deal more about GLSL.</p>
